# Accessing the Dall-e mini API Using a CORS Proxy

This is a simple example of how to use the Dall-e mini (Crayion) API with a CORS proxy.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

## Warning

This is a proof of concept and is not intended for production use. It is not secure and should not be used in production.
Also, this prevents Crayion from earning revenue from usage of the API and is not recommended.
